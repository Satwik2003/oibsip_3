# Oasis Infobyte Task 3

This repository is to show my work for task 3 of the Data Science internship at Oasis Infobyte.

## Task 3 - Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

Task 3 was to develop a predictive model to predict the optimal price of cars in the market, considering variables such as, mileage, etc.

## Approach 

Since the data was quite linear, I used sci-kit's Linear Regression algorithm.

## Performance

The model achieved a R-squared scores of 0.94 and 0.89 on training and testing sets, respectively.
